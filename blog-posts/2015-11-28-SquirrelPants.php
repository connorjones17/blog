concept for our database project was to build an online shop that sold Squirrel Pants. And, you're right
to think that we as an Academy are absolutely bonkers but I will explain how we got there later on in this post.

For now, I will start off with the basics by declaring that our database 'language' of choice is called MySQL. This
basically allows us to set up a table (kind of like excel) with unique column names and insert data for us to access
at a later point (or whenever we want really). Many companies around the world will store absolutely everything they could
think of putting into a table. Google records data on every product, service, team, system etc that they own. They then
start to formulate gold mines of data and it's incredible what a few small, well designed tables can tell you about your
data.

MySQL is a pretty neat language and it is written in a similar way to how you would speak which makes writing the language
a lot easier and more understandable. For example if i was to write SELECT player_name FROM blackjack_game WHERE
player_name  = 'Beth';. Even without knowing anything about programming or databases you would expect this data to select
all the players with the name of 'Beth' from the blackjack table. I think this makes SQL quite unique and it seems to be
something that other languages are trying to adopt. Immediately this code becomes readable to everyone and will therefore
produce more succinct, maintainable and efficient code. Pretty cool.
